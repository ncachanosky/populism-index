## The Index

### Introduction

The **Latin America Left-Leaning Populism Index** serves as a measure of active populist policies and comprises two sub-indices: Economic Populism and Institutional Populism.

Each sub-index is derived from the interaction of populist rhetoric with typical left-leaning policies, resulting in the following two measurements:

* Economic populism $(EP)$
* Institutional populism $(IP)$.

These sub-indices represent the intersection of populism policies (economic or institutional) with populist motives. Take, for example, income distributionâ€”a common left-leaning populist policy. However, not all income distribution policies are implemented by populist regimes. A high populist index necessitates the execution of populist policies, such as income distribution, driven by populist reasons. To achieve this, the index incorporates economic and institutional policies with a measure of populist rhetoric. Different from other indices, this construct observes if (a) populist rhetoric becomes action, and (b) if action is due to populist reasons.

Each sub-index is constructed with several areas, all adjusted to a scale ranging from 0 (less populism) to 100 (more populism), and each area holds equal weight.

By aligning populist policies with populist rhetoric, the index distinguishes between non-populist regimes implementing populist policies and populist regimes failing to do so. This disaggregated information enables the study of various scenarios, including::

1. The effects of populism (the overall index)
2. The effects of economic populism
3. The effects of institutional populism
4. The effects of economic populist policies carried out by a non-populist regime
5. The effects of institutional populist policies carried out by a non-populist regime
6. The effects of a populist regime that does not carry out populist policies

### Methodology

The index is the arithmetic average of $EP$ and $IP$ adjusted to measure populist motives.

$\mathcal{I} = \frac{(\text{Populist rhetoric} \times \text{Populist economic policies}) + (\text{Populist rhetoric} \times \text{Populist institutional policies})}{2}$

$\mathcal{I} = \frac{(POP \cdot EP) + (POP \cdot IP)}{2} = P \cdot \left(\frac{EP + IP}{2}\right)$

Where `POP` is a measure of populist rhetoric and `EP` and `IP` denote economic and institutional populism respectively.

Subsequently, each sub-index is the arithmetic average of their components.

### Populism rhetoric

The measure of *populism rhetoric* is the V-Party Populism index. The index data is re-escaled from [0, 1] to [0, 100]. 

The V-Party Populism Index gauges the populist rhetoric exhibited by active political parties in each country. The index aligns with the political party affiliation of the head of state. In years when there is a transition in the executive office, the data reflects the party with the majority of days in office.

### Economic Populism $(EP)$

The Economic Populism Sub-Index looks at the following four (4) economic policy areas typically observed in Latin American populist regimes:

1. Business (and labor market) regulations
2. Government interference
3. Monetary (and financial) freedom
4. Freedom to trade (internationally)

$$
EP = P \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Business regulations + Gov. interferences + Monetary freedom + Freedom to trade}}{4}\right) = P \cdot \left(\frac{EP_1 + EP_2 + EP_3 + EP_4}{4}\right)
$$

The contributors to each economic policy area are the following

* $EP_1 = (EP_{11} + EP_{12} + EP_{13})/3$
* $EP_2 = (EP_{21} + EP_{22})/2$
* $EP_3 = (EP_{31} + EP_{32} + EP_{33})/3$
* $EP_4 = (EP_{41} + EP_{42})/2$

where:

* $EP_{11}$ = Heritage's Foundation Index of Economic Freedom: Business freedom.
* $EP_{12}$ = Fraser's Economic Freedom of the World: Labor Market Regulations (5A).
* $EP_{13}$ = Fraser's Economic Freedom of the World: Business Regulations (5C).
* $EP_{21}$ = Fraser's Economic Freedom of the World: Transfers and Subsidies (1B).
* $EP_{22}$ = Fraser's Economic Freedom of the World: State Ownership (IE).
* $EP_{31}$ = Heritage's Foundation Index of Economic Freedom: Monetary Freedom.
* $EP_{32}$ = Heritage's Foundation Index of Economic Freedom: Financial Freedom.
* $EP_{33}$ = Fraser's Economic Freedom of the World: Foreign Currency and Bank Accounts (3D).
* $EP_{41}$ = Heritage's Foundation Index of Economic Freedom: Trade Freedom.
* $EP_{42}$ = Fraser's Economic Freedom of the World: Freedom to Trade Internationally (4).

### Institutional Populism $(IP)$

The Institutional Populism Sub-Index looks at the following five (5) institutional areas typically observed in Latin American populist regimes:

1. Rule of Law
2. Corruption
3. Neopatrimonialism
4. Freedom of the Expression
5. Property Rights


$$
IP = \frac{\text{Rule of Law + Corruption + Neopatrimonialism + Freedom of Expression + Property Rights}}{5} = \frac{IP_1 + IP_2 + IP_3 + IP_4 + IP_5}{5}
$$

The contributors to each economic policy area are the following

* $IP_1 = (IP_{11} + IP_{12} + IP_{13} + IP_{14})/4$
* $IP_2 = (IP_{21} + IP_{22})/2$
* $IP_3 = IP_{31}$
* $IP_4 = IP_{41}$
* $IP_5 = IP_{51}$

where:

* $IP_{11}$ = V-Dem: Rule of Law.
* $IP_{12}$ = V-Dem: Judiciary Constraints on the Executive.
* $IP_{13}$ = V-Dem: Legislative Constraints on the Executive.
* $IP_{14}$ = WGI: Rule of Law.
* $IP_{21}$ = V-Dem: Corruption.
* $IP_{22}$ = WGI: Control of Corruption.
* $IP_{31}$ = V-Dem: Neopatrimonialism.
* $IP_{41}$ = V-Dem: Freedom of Expression.
* $IP_{51}$ = Heritage's Foundation Index of Economic Freedom: Property Rights.
