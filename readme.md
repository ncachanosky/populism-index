# Latin America (left-leaning) Populism Index Project

## The Index

The index has two sub-indices: (a) Economic populism $(EP)$ and (b) Institutional populism $(IP)$. Both sub-indices range from 0 (less) to 100 (more) populism.

Each sub-index is the interaction of populism policies with populist motives. Take, for instance, income distribution. This is a typical left-leaning populist policy, but not all of income distribution policies are carried by populist regimes. A high populist index requires a populist policy (such as income distribution) executed for populist reasons.

$$
\mathcal{I} = \frac{EP + IP}{2}
$$

where:

$$
\begin{align*}
EP &= \text{Populist rhetoric} \times \text{Populist economic policies} \\
IP &= \text{Populist rhetoric} \times \text{Populist institutional policies}
\\end{align*}
$$

## Economic Populism $(EP$)

### Budget Deficits

### Public Debt

### Inflation Rate

### Redistribution:

1) Relative redistribution. Measures the extent to which governments use taxes and transfers to redistribute income by comparing income inequality in the market to post-tax, post-transfer inequality.

Formula: $\frac{Gini_{Market} - Gini_{Post}}{Gini_{Market}}$

## Institutional Populism $(IP)$

### Rule of Law

### Attacks on the Judiciary

### Attacks on the Legislative

### Corruption

### Freedom of the Press
